# Solution Summary: Missing email_verified Column

## Issue

When trying to insert a user with the `email_verified` column, the following error occurred:
```
[2025-05-25 14:29:51] [42703] ERROR: column "email_verified" of relation "users" does not exist
[2025-05-25 14:29:51] Position: 47
```

## Root Cause

The `email_verified` column is defined in:
- The Java entity class (`User.java`)
- The SQL creation script (`create_tables.sql`)

However, it was missing from the actual database table. This can happen if:
- The database was created before this column was added to the entity
- The database was created manually without including this column
- The column was accidentally dropped or renamed

## Solution

Two files were created to fix this issue:

1. **fix_users_table.sql**: A SQL script that:
   - Checks if the `email_verified` column exists in the users table
   - Adds the column if it doesn't exist
   - Updates existing users to have `email_verified` set to `true`

2. **EMAIL_VERIFIED_COLUMN_FIX.md**: Documentation that:
   - Explains the issue and its causes
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for applying the fix
   - Includes verification steps to confirm the fix worked

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Execute the `fix_users_table.sql` script using either:
   - IntelliJ IDEA Database Tools
   - psql Command Line

2. Verify the fix by inserting a user with the `email_verified` column:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, email_verified, role)
   VALUES (
       'teacher',
       'teacher@studyplatform.com',
       '$2a$10$dXJ3SW6G7P50lGmMkkmwe.20cQQubK3.HZWzG3YB1tlRy.fqvM/BG',
       true,
       'TEACHER'
   );
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always use the provided SQL scripts to create database tables
- If using Hibernate's auto-creation, ensure the application runs at least once before trying to insert data manually
- Keep database schema documentation up to date
