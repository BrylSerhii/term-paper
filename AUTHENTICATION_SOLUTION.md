# Authentication Solution for Study Platform

## Issue Description

The issue was that when a user registers, their password is stored in the database as a BCrypt hash (a long string like `$2a$10$6bqae8.7qZ5Vn5VRS94rl.FI5Gs6OcosNUxdIWpHeRUjzfwfIqy2S`), but the user couldn't log in with their original password. Additionally, there was no functionality to keep users logged in until they decide to log out.

## Solution Overview

The solution implements a complete authentication flow with JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management:

1. **Password Hashing**: The system correctly uses BCrypt to hash passwords for security. This is why passwords appear as long strings in the database.

2. **JWT Token Authentication**: When a user logs in, they receive a JWT token that is stored in the browser's localStorage.

3. **Session Persistence**: The token is sent with subsequent requests to maintain the user's session until they log out.

4. **Protected Dashboard**: A dashboard page was created that is only accessible to authenticated users.

5. **Token Validation**: A new endpoint was added to validate tokens and retrieve user information.

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Added Token Validation Endpoint**:
   - Created `/api/auth/validate-token` endpoint in `AuthenticationController`
   - This endpoint verifies the JWT token and returns user information

2. **Updated Security Configuration**:
   - Modified `SecurityConfig` to protect the dashboard page
   - Configured specific authentication rules for different endpoints

### Frontend Changes

1. **Authentication Utility**:
   - Added `fetchWithAuth` function to include JWT token in API requests
   - Implemented token validation on page load

2. **Dashboard Page**:
   - Created a protected dashboard page (`dashboard.html`)
   - Added JavaScript to verify authentication and display user information

3. **Session Management**:
   - Implemented proper storage of JWT token in localStorage
   - Added logout functionality to clear the token
   - Added session expiration handling

4. **Navigation Updates**:
   - Added dashboard link for logged-in users
   - Updated UI to show user information when logged in

## How It Works

1. **Registration**:
   - User registers with username, email, and password
   - Password is hashed with BCrypt before storage
   - User receives email verification (if enabled)

2. **Login**:
   - User enters username and password
   - System verifies credentials against the hashed password
   - Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and stored in localStorage

3. **Session Management**:
   - The JWT token is included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests
   - The token is validated on the server side
   - If the token is valid, the user remains logged in
   - If the token is invalid or expired, the user is redirected to login

4. **Logout**:
   - User clicks logout
   - Token is removed from localStorage
   - User is redirected to the home page

## Testing the Solution

To test the authentication system:

1. **Register a new account**:
   - Go to the home page and click "Register"
   - Fill in the registration form
   - Submit the form

2. **Log in with your credentials**:
   - Go to the home page and click "Login"
   - Enter your username and password
   - Click "Login"

3. **Access the dashboard**:
   - After logging in, click on "Dashboard" in the navigation bar
   - Verify that your user information is displayed

4. **Test session persistence**:
   - Close the browser and reopen it
   - Navigate to the application
   - You should still be logged in

5. **Test logout**:
   - Click "Logout" in the navigation bar
   - Verify that you are redirected to the home page
   - Verify that you can no longer access the dashboard

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text. They are hashed using BCrypt.

2. **Token Security**: JWT tokens are signed with a secret key and have an expiration time.

3. **Protected Routes**: The dashboard and other sensitive pages are protected from unauthorized access.

4. **HTTPS**: In production, ensure the application is served over HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.
